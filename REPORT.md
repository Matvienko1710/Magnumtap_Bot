# Functional Stability Report

Role: Senior Maintainer — ensure all existing functionality works without changing behavior.

## Stack and Entry Points
- Node.js + Telegraf (Telegram bot), Express (health endpoints/WebApp APIs), MongoDB native driver
- Entry: `magnum-bot-final.js`
- DB connect/start: `connectDB()` -> `startBot()`
- Commands/handlers: extensive `bot.start`, `bot.action`, API endpoints under `/api/webapp/*`

## Issues Found
1. Await outside async (runtime crash risk on deploy)
   - await used at top-level due to duplicated startup block after merge.
2. Bot not reacting to /start
   - Telegraf was not launched in current startup path.
3. WebApp logs after disabling WebApp
   - Noisy logs confused ops (not a functional bug, but impacted visibility).
4. Exchange 24h state lost on deploy
   - Non-persistent `exchangeRate24h`/`lastRateUpdate` reset after each deploy.

## Fixes (minimal diff)
- magnum-bot-final.js
  - FIX: Remove duplicated top-level startup block and keep `await` calls inside `async function startBot()`.
  - FIX: Add `await bot.launch()` after `getMe()` to start polling updates.
  - FIX: Gate WebApp file-check logs behind `WEBAPP_ENABLED` and clean misleading server logs.
  - FIX: Persist `exchangeRate24h` and `lastRateUpdate` in MongoDB `config` collection and restore on startup.

Each fix annotated inline with comments where applicable.

## Why safe
- No public interfaces, routes, commands, or DB schemas changed.
- Behavior preserved; only broken paths corrected and state made persistent.

## Verification Steps (Smoke test)
1. Set env: `BOT_TOKEN`, `MONGODB_URI`, optional `PORT`, `WEBAPP_ENABLED=false`.
2. Start: `npm start`.
3. Logs should show successful DB connect, indices created, Express started, bot info printed, and "успешно запущен".
4. In Telegram DM the bot: send `/start` — bot should respond and proceed to subscription check/main menu.
5. WebApp logs should be quiet when `WEBAPP_ENABLED=false`.
6. Let the bot run over a daily boundary or force a rate update to trigger 24h rate save; restart container — logs show restored `exchangeRate24h`/`lastRateUpdate`.

## Notes
- No dependency changes were required.
- No refactors/renames.
